# Fork info
This fork of Better Foliage is provided as is and is only for Minecraft 1.7.10.
I created this fork to fix a minor issue with the lotr mod, and **I'm not planning on doing any other major work on it**.
The code is open source, so feel free to pr bugfixes, fork my version etc.

Like the 1.10 & 1.12 versions of Better Foliage, this fork requires [Forgelin](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Forgelin)
